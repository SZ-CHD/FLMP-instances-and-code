DDPBP is the source code of the double-decomposition based parallel exact algorithm.
BAP_Following_Step_5 and _6 are the forward and backward search process of DDPBP.
You need to manually open the Matlab parallel pool with at least two cores available, before running DDPBP.
Please make sure that all the components are in the same folder when running DDPBP.
